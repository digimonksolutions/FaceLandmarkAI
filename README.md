# Face Landmark Detection with TensorFlow

## Overview
This project is designed to detect key facial landmarks (such as eyes, nose, and mouth) in images. The system uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) built with TensorFlow to analyze facial features, making it applicable for facial recognition, expression analysis, and image editing.

### Potential Applications:
- Facial recognition
- Expression analysis
- Image editing

### Intended Audience:
- Developers
- Researchers interested in facial image analysis
